1. The game consists of four colored buttons: red, blue, green, and yellow.
2. The game starts with a pattern of colors being shown to the player. For example, the pattern could be red, blue, green, yellow.
3. The player's task is to remember and repeat the pattern of colors in the exact order that they were shown.
4. To repeat the pattern, the player needs to press the corresponding colored buttons in the same order. For example, if the pattern was red, blue, green, yellow, the player would need to press the red button, then the blue button, then the green button, and finally the yellow button.

6. As the game progresses, the pattern becomes longer and more challenging. The player must continue to remember and accurately repeat the pattern.
7. If the player presses the wrong button or makes a mistake in the sequence, the game ends and the player's score is displayed.

9. The goal is to achieve the highest score possible by correctly repeating the increasingly complex patterns.
The Simon game tests and improves your memory, concentration, and pattern recognition skills. It can be played alone or with others to compete for high scores.
